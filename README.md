#Scala Exchange 2013

Twitter streaming & simple sentiment analysis application. To build & run the plain-vanilla version of the application, run ``sbt run``. Then you can type in the ``track`` command, which expects the Twitter search term to track. See https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/filter for ``track`` filter.

##Twitter application
Before you run the application, create the ``~/.twitter/scalaexchange2013`` file, containing four lines; these lines represent your twitter consumer key and secret, followed by token value and token secret. To generate these values, head over to https://dev.twitter.com/apps/, create an application and add the appropriate lines to this file. An example ``~/.twitter/scalaexchange2013`` is

```
*************TqOdlxA
****************************Fv9b1ELexCRhI
********-*************************GUjmnWQvZ5GwnBR2
***********************************ybgUNqrZwD
```

Naturally, the you will need to replace the ``*``s with the values in your consumer token and secret; and token value and secret.

##Running
Having added the file above, you can see the application "in action", by run ``sbt run`` in an ANSI terminal. Once running, type in ``track christmas``, ``track daley``, or anything else that tickles your fancy.
